# Smake
Makes a lot synthetic accelerograms.

The main purpose of the program is to generate twin accelerograms starting from a real record.

Along with a series of predefined parameters, it is important to control the convergence of the solver, which is fine-tuned for records with a sampling frequence of 2000Hz
